## Project Overview
You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice. The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

## What will I learn?

1. Connecting to an API
2. Parsing the response of the API
3. Handling error cases gracefully
4. Updating information regularly
5. Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
